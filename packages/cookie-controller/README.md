## Supporting GDPR-Related Features

Our Cookie Controller is developed with GDPR considerations in mind and includes features that support adherence to GDPR principles. It's important to note that while this tool offers functionalities aligning with GDPR requirements, full compliance depends on how the tool is implemented within your website's broader context and architecture.

### Key Features

- **Explicit Consent Management:** The controller facilitates the collection of explicit user consent for cookies, barring the use of pre-ticked boxes or implied consent strategies.

- **Granular Consent Options:** Users can provide consent selectively for different types of cookies, such as analytical, functional, or marketing cookies, enabling a more tailored consent experience.

- **Easy Consent Withdrawal:** The tool ensures that withdrawing consent is as straightforward as giving it, allowing users to modify their preferences with ease.

- **Transparency and Information:** It provides clear information about the use of cookies, helping website owners inform users about what cookies are active, their purpose, and their duration.

- **Consent Record Keeping:** While the tool does not store personal data, it generates a unique session identifier to record consent details, which helps in maintaining an audit trail without compromising user privacy.

- **Accessibility and Usability:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that consent options are easily navigable and understandable.

### Implementation Note

For effective use, itâ€™s essential that the Proto Cookie Controller is configured and integrated in line with your specific website requirements. The actual GDPR compliance of your website will depend on multiple factors, including how cookies are used and managed beyond just obtaining consent.

### Disclaimer

This tool is provided to assist in aligning with GDPR-related requirements for cookie management. However, it's important to consult with a legal expert in GDPR compliance for comprehensive guidance and to ensure that your website fully meets all regulatory obligations.
